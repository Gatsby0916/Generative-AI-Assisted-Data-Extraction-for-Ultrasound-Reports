Today's ultrasound was a sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. Whilst endometriosis was identified,
we are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to be considered
for this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure optimal accuracy,
enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter endometriosis and
severe endometriosis-associated adhesions.
