ENDOMETRIOSIS ULTRASOUND:
Our patient consented to a limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound examination using real-time
transabdominal scan and transvaginal scan technique.
INDICATION: hx of dysmenorrhea. Hx of appendectomy
FINDINGS:
UTERUS:
The uterus was well visualized, anteverted in orientation and size measuring 64 x 44 x 68 mm.
Myometrium: The myometrium appeared normal.
Adenomyosis: Evaluation for adenomyosis revealed: Nil.
Fibroids: Evaluation for fibroids revealed: Nil.
Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 15 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology: None.
OVARIES/ADNEXA:
Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 31 x 16
x 34 mm. Volume 8.8 ml. The following criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology are noted: equal
or greater than 20 follicles.
Right Ovary Mobility: Mobile
Left Ovary: the left ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 41 x 30 x 34
mm. Volume 21.7 ml. There is a unilocular cystic lesion measuring 21 x 18 x 22 mm with some internal
echoes (reticular/web-like), smooth and thin walls, no solid components, and with peripheral 'ring of
fire'. This is a functional hemorrhagic cyst.
The following criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology are noted: equal or greater than 20 follicles.
Left Ovary Mobility: Mobile
Adnexa: Normal bilaterally.

Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: abnormal with evidence of deep infiltrative endometriosis at the level of
the left USL measuring 9.0 x 4.5 x 9.6 mm
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac):
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Abnormal. There is a peritoneal pocket in the left pararectal space. This is an indirect feature of
endometriosis.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was aided by the presence
of peritoneal fluid. We identified superficial endometriosis on the rectouterine pouch peritoneum. It
is important to note that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial
endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with main findings including deep and
superficial endometriosis (peritoneal pocket). Both ovaries have polycystic ovarian morphology. Clinical
correlation is required to decide whether the patient meets the other Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria
for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
