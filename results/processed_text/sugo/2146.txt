ADVANCED GYNECOLOGY ULTRASOUND (ENDOMETRIOSIS SONOGRAPHER-LED):
Our patient consented to a full pelvic ultrasound examination using real-time transabdominal scan
and transvaginal scan technique. Due to the indication of endometriosis on the requisition,
advanced dynamic techniques, including limited abdominal ultrasound, were performed.
INDICATION: Severe dysmenorrhea, suspected primary dysmenorrhea vs endometriosis
FINDINGS:
UTERUS:
The uterus was well visualized, anteverted in orientation and size measuring 55 x 50 x 40 mm.
Volume 57.5 ml.
Myometrium: The myometrium appeared normal.
Adenomyosis: Evaluation for adenomyosis revealed: Nil.
Fibroids: Evaluation for fibroids revealed: Nil.
Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 3.0 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology: None.
OVARIES/ADNEXA:
Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared normal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 27 x 23 x
20 mm. Volume 6.3 ml.
Right Ovary Mobility: Mobile
Left Ovary: the left ovary appeared normal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 19 x 19 x 12
mm. Volume 2.2 ml. Difficult to assess due to bowel.
Left Ovary Mobility: Mobile
Adnexa: Normal bilaterally.

Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal)
rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was aided by the presence
of peritoneal fluid. We did not identify superficial endometriosis. It is important to note that the
absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Normal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today.
No evidence of deep or ovarian endometriosis or endometriosis-associated adhesions. While we can
safely rule these out based on evidence-based diagnostic test accuracy studies, it is important to
note that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
It is important to note that a normal ultrasound does not signify the patient is normal; rather, it
simply means we have not visualized anatomical abnormalities in the structures evaluated on today's
ultrasound.
Today's ultrasound was a sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. Whilst we did not identify
endometriosis, we are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to
be considered for this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure
optimal accuracy, enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter
