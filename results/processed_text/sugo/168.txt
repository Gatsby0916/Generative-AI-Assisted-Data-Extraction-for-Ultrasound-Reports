PELVIC ULTRASOUND
HISTORY:
Nulligravida. Dysmenorrhoea, dyschezia, urinary frequency, ovulation pain ?endometriosis
FINDINGS:
Transvaginal ultrasound performed
Uterus:
The uterus is retroverted and is normal in size at 77 x 48 x 41mm (vol 79.7 ml).
There are no focal or diffuse myometrial abnormalities.
The endometrial thickness measures 12mm which is within normal limts for day 25 of menstrual cycle. No focal
endometrial lesion identified.
The uterine cavity shape is normal on 3D coronal images.
Right Ovary:
The right ovary measures 38 x 25 x 25mm (vol 12.4cc) and contains 19 follicles (2 - 9mm). A 20mm corpus
luteum was visualised.
Left Ovary:
The left ovary measures 29 x 25 x 15mm (vol 5.6cc) and contains 17 follicles (2 - 9mm).
No adnexal masses or cysts were noted. No free fluid was present in the pelvis.
Endometriosis Ultrasound:
The vaginal wall and uterosacral ligaments are not thickened and have normal mobility.
There is a nodule of endometriosis within the left uterosacral ligament measuring 6 x 4 x 9mm.
There is a nodule of endometriosis within the right uterosacral ligament measuring 8 x 2 x 5mm.
The ovaries, uterus and bladder have normal mobility.
The rectal muscularis was examined to the level of the distal sigmoid colon. There was normal movement of the
rectum and no endometriotic bowel nodules were identified.
Both ovaries were very tender to probe pressure.
CONCLUSION
9mm nodule of endometriosis within the right uterosacral ligament. 8mm nodule of endoemtriosis within the left
uterosacral ligament.
Normal appearance and mobility of the uterus, ovaries, bladder and rectum. Superficial deposits of endometriosis
will not routinely be identified on ultrasound.
