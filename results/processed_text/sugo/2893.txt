The following were identified:
- Adenomyosis
No evidence of deep or ovarian endometriosis or endometriosis-associated adhesions. While we can safely
rule these out based on evidence-based diagnostic test accuracy studies, it is important to note that the
absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
Today's adenomyosis features are very subtle.

endometriosis, we are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to
be considered for this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure
optimal accuracy, enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter
endometriosis and severe endometriosis-associated adhesions, even though these were not identified today.
