POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was/was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. We did not identify superficial endometriosis. It is important to note
that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Normal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with no findings of endometriosis or
adenomyosis. It is important to note that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out
superficial endometriosis.
We would suggest considering a sonohysterography to try and better visualize superficial
endometriosis using sonoPODography after installing fluid into the rectouterine pouch.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
