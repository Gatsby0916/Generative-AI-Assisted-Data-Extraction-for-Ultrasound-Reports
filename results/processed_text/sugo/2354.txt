Adnexa: Normal bilaterally.
ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.

Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was aided by the presence
of peritoneal fluid. We identified: None. It is important to note that the absence of superficial
endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with main findings including
adenomyosis.
No evidence of deep or ovarian endometriosis or endometriosis-associated adhesions. While we can
safely rule these out based on evidence-based diagnostic test accuracy studies, it is important to
note that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.

During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
