ENDOMETRIOSIS ULTRASOUND:
Our patient consented to a limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound examination using real-time
transabdominal scan and transvaginal scan technique.
INDICATION: Previous surgery, increasing AUB, PCB, wanting hysterectomy.
FINDINGS:
UTERUS:
The uterus was well visualized, anteverted in orientation and size measuring 55 x 51 x 91 mm.
Myometrium: The myometrium appeared abnormal.
Adenomyosis: Evaluation for adenomyosis revealed: Present. The following MUSA criteria were
seen:
1. Globular
2. Fan-shaped acoustic shadowing
3. Subendometrial buds/lines
4. Irregular junctional zone
5. Interrupted junctional zone
6. Myometrial cysts
Fibroids: Evaluation for fibroids revealed: Present.
1. Fundal type 3 measuring 12 x 9 x 11 mm.
Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 10.0 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology: Possible
polyp measuring 12.8 x 10.4 x 7.8 mm, difficult to assess endometrium due to the adenomyosis. IUD
is not in the correct position - low in the uterine body and cervix.

Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 46 x 43
x 43 mm. Volume 44.5 ml. There is are two unilocular cystic lesion measuring 40 x 31 x 25 mm 25 x 16
x 20 mm with ground glass echogenic contents, smooth and thin walls, no solid components, and no
abnormal Doppler vascularity. The first is clearly an endometrioma and the second, which is a bit
harder to visualize, is also likely an endometrioma, but may be a hemorrhagic cyst.
Right Ovary Mobility: Fixed laterally and medially
Left Ovary: the left ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 37 x 30 x 32
mm. Volume 12.9 ml. There is a unilocular cystic lesion measuring 26 x 18 x 24 mm with ground glass
echogenic contents, smooth and thin walls, no solid components, and no abnormal Doppler
vascularity. This is benign as per the IOTA Simple Rules. This is an endometrioma as per IOTA Easy
Descriptors.
Left Ovary Mobility: Fixed in all directions
Adnexa: Normal bilaterally.
ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Abnormal with irregularity of the ligament but no nodule.
Torus uterinus: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis nodule measuring 7.8 x 5.0 x 8.0 mm.
Bowel: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis nodule measuring 19.9 x 15.3 x 9.3
mm. Left endometrioma is tethered to this nodule.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Sliding sign: Negative, representing an obliterated rectouterine
pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. We identified: Superficial endometriosis on the right USL in the form of

a hypoechoic irregularity of the ligament.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with main findings including
endometriosis (severe including bowel, obliteration), adenomyosis, fibroid, probable endometrial
polyp.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
