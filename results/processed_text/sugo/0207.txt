isthmocele
IUD: Correctly positioned.
OVARIES/ADNEXA:
Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 61 x 38

Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with findings of a large right ovarian
dermoid cyst. There is no endometriosis or adenomyosis identified. There are no endometriosis-
associated adhesions but there are bladder-to-uterus adhesions. It is important to note that the
absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided the patient real-time feedback regarding the
ultrasound findings. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
