FREE FLUID: Absent
ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal)
rectouterine pouch.
Triangle sign: Negative.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the presence of
peritoneal fluid. We did not identify superficial endometriosis. It is important to note that the absence of
superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Overall normal complete pelvic ultrasound today.
There is a benign right paratubal cyst of no clinical significance.
Though no endometriosis was noted, there was one suspicious area on the review of images in the right
uterosacral ligament region, worth of reassessment. This would IDEALLY be planned for post-ovulation
As per the latest guidelines on the assessment of PCOS, ultrasound is no longer appropriate to use in
adolescent individuals to assess the ovaries for follicle number or volume. Today's patient falls into this
adolescent period (within 8 years of menarche), so the appearance of their ovaries is irrelevant to the
potential PCOS diagnosis. PCOS may still be diagnosed using the other criteria. If there is ongoing concern for
PCOS beyond adolescents or in the case of multifollicular appearing ovaries today, a repeat scan can be
considered then.

Today's ultrasound was a sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. Whilst we did not identify
endometriosis, we are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to
be considered for this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure
optimal accuracy, enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter
endometriosis and severe endometriosis-associated adhesions, even though these were not identified today.
