ADVANCED GYNECOLOGY ULTRASOUND (ENDOMETRIOSIS SONOGRAPHER-LED):
Our patient consented to a full pelvic ultrasound examination using real-time transabdominal scan
and transvaginal scan technique. Due to the indication of endometriosis on the requisition,
advanced dynamic techniques, including limited abdominal ultrasound, were performed.
INDICATION: 69 yo F with two left ovarian lesions - 21 mm arrested follicle and 11 mm ? old
endometrioma.
FINDINGS:
UTERUS:
The uterus was well visualized, retroverted in orientation and size measuring 41 x 41 x 28 mm.
Volume 24.5 ml.
Myometrium: The myometrium appeared abnormal.
Adenomyosis: Evaluation for adenomyosis revealed: Focal anterior myometrial cyst is noted
today.
Fibroids: Evaluation for fibroids revealed: Nil.
Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 5.1 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology: Present.
There are at least two cystic areas with vascularity measuring 5 x 5 x 3 mm in the fundal aspect and 3
x 3 x 2 mm in the right/lower aspect - probable polyps. The endometrium is thinner today than at
previous scan in May 2024 (was there hysteroscopy or biopsy done?)
OVARIES/ADNEXA:
Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared normal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 12 x 8 x 13
mm. Volume 0.6 ml.
Right Ovary Mobility: Mobile
Left Ovary: the left ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 27 x 21 x 17
mm. Volume 5.1 ml. There is an arrested follicle measuring 17 x 21 x 17 mm. There is a 11 x 9 x 7 mm
anechoic lesion with a hyperechoic component measuring 6 x 7 x 5 mm. This appears the same as previous.

This ovary is adherent to the LUSL DE (see below), which further raises the likelihood that this is an old
endometrioma.
Left Ovary Mobility: Fixed
Adnexa: In the left adnexa, there is a 24 x 10 x 7 mm anechoic and tubular structure measuring 24 x
10 x 7 mm. This represents a hydrosalpinx.
ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis measuring 7.3 x 6.7 x 2.2 mm.
Right uterosacral ligament, torus uterinus: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis measuring
8.7 x 5.7 x 4.0 mm.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal)
rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. We identified superficial endometriosis in the right USL/torus area.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today.
Findings include:
probable adenomyosis
possible endometrial polyps - clinical correlation following last scan needed
right and left USL deep endometriosis
benign left ovarian cysts, one is likely a small old endometrioma based on fixation to LUSL DE

superficial endometriosis
Today's ultrasound was a sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. Whilst endometriosis was identified,
we are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to be considered
for this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure optimal accuracy,
enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter endometriosis and severe
endometriosis-associated adhesions.
