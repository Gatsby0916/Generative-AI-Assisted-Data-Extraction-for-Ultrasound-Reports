During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
