Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Nodule at the base of the ligament measuring 4.8 x 1.9 x 3.7 mm.
There is a second nodule noted in the right pouch of Douglas, close to the para-rectal space
mearsuing 4.3 x 5.8 x 5.3 mm.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Sliding + Triangle sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e.
normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was aided by the presence
of peritoneal fluid. We did identify superficial endometriosis on the right uterosacal ligament in the
form of a small superficial cystic space and small hyperechoic foci.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with findings of endometriosis in the
forms of two small nodules noted in the right uterosacral ligament and para-rectal space, as well as
superficial endometriosis. There is no evidence of adenomyosis. Ovaries are normal and mobole and
responding well to FSH stimulation.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
