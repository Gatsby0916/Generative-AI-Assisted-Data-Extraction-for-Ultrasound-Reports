ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis nodule measuring 10.6 x 3.7 x
9.4 mm. There is evidence of adherence of the rectum to this nodule but no evidence of a rectal nodule.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis nodule measuring 5.4 x 5.1 x 4.7 mm.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Partially negative, representing a partially obliterated rectouterine pouch of the left side.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. We did not identify superficial endometriosis. It is important to note
that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with findings of deeply infiltrating
endometriosis of the torus uterinus and left uterosacral ligament and possible early stage adenomyosis.
There is evidence of adherence of the lateral aspect of the rectum to the left uterosacral ligament
nodule, though no evidence of deeply infiltrating endometriosis of the rectal wall itself. It is
important to note that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial
endometriosis.

During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
