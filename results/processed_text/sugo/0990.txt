Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was aided by the presence
of peritoneal fluid. We identified: Superficial endometriosis on the rectouterine pouch peritoneum.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with main findings including superficial
endometriosis.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. Specifically, I highlighted the importance of pelvic floor physiotherapy as she describes bladder
pain symptoms (that are not proven as infectious), which reveals significant involvement of the pelvic floor. It
was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to your patient's
diagnostic journey.
