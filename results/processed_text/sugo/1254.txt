Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 5.0 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology:
Abnormal. There is an intrauterine adhesion centrally noted. This is in proximity to the adenomyosis.
Likely the adenomyosis and intrauterine adhesion have a similar inciting event, usually something

cannot rule out superficial endometriosis at this time. A history of Chlamydia may also yield pelvic
inflammatory disease that could yield persistent pain.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
