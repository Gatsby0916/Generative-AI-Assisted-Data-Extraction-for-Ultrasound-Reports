Today's ultrasound was a sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. Whilst endometriosis was identified, we
are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to be considered for
this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure optimal accuracy,
enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter endometriosis and severe
endometriosis-associated adhesions.
