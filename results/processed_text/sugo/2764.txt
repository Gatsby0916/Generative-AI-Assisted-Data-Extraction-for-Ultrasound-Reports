Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Sliding sign: Negative, representing an obliterated (i.e. abnormal)
rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the presence of
peritoneal fluid. We did not identify superficial endometriosis. It is important to note that the absence of
superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal complete pelvic ultrasound today.
Cervix noted measuring 26 x 30 x 33 with blood within with low-level echoes measuring 17 x 16 x 5 mm.
This is highly likely the source of the spotting. There is bowel endometriosis, which is adherent to the cervix,
resulting in obliteration of the rectouterine pouch. In the event the cervix will need to be removed, this would
be a complex/challenging surgery and referral to MIGS would be necessary.
Today's ultrasound was a sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. Whilst endometriosis was identified,
we are still at the infancy of sonographer-led endometriosis ultrasound. If surgery is going to be considered
for this patient, I would recommend a sonologist-led endometriosis ultrasound to ensure optimal accuracy,
enhancing surgical outcomes, particularly for the domains of bowel/bladder/ureter endometriosis and
severe endometriosis-associated adhesions.
