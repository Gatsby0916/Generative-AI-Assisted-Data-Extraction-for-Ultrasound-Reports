ENDOMETRIOSIS ULTRASOUND:
Our patient consented to a limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound examination using real-time
transabdominal scan and transvaginal scan technique. The bladder was very full throughout the
entire scan.
INDICATION: Dysmenorrhea; h/o autonomic bladder
FINDINGS:
UTERUS:
The uterus was well visualized, anteverted in orientation and size measuring 92 x 44 x 47 mm.
Myometrium: The myometrium appeared normal.
Adenomyosis: Evaluation for adenomyosis revealed: Nil.
Fibroids: Evaluation for fibroids revealed: Nil.
Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 4 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology: None.
OVARIES/ADNEXA:
Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared normal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 32 x 15 x
28 mm. Volume 6.7 ml (on TA scan)
Left Ovary: the left ovary appeared normal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 23 x 21 x 33
mm. Volume 8.4 ml (on TA scan).
Adnexa: Normal bilaterally.
ANTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.

POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. We identified:None. It is important to note that the absence of
superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Normal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today (besides the very full bladder).
No evidence of deep or ovarian endometriosis or endometriosis-associated adhesions. While we can
safely rule these out based on evidence-based diagnostic test accuracy studies, it is important to
note that the absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
It is important to note that a normal ultrasound does not signify the patient is normal; rather, it
simply means we have not visualized anatomical abnormalities in the structures evaluated on today's
ultrasound.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
