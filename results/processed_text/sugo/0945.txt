POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Abnormal with evidence of deep endometriosis nodule measuring 6.6 x
2.4 x 7.4 mm.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was aided by the presence
of peritoneal fluid. We did not identify any superficial endometriosis. It is important to note that the
absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with main findings including deep
endometriosis of the left uterosacral ligament. There are no findings suggestive of ovarian
endometriosis or severe adhesions. It is important to note that the absence of superficial endometriosis
does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
The right ovary has polycystic ovarian morphology. Clinical correlation is required to decide whether the
patient meets the other Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
