Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
Kidneys: No hydronephrosis bilaterally.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. We identified: None. It is important to note that the absence of
superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
IMPRESSION:
Normal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with no findings including endometriosis
and adenomyosis. No adhesions noted. It is important to note that the absence of superficial
endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
It is important to note that a normal pelvic ultrasound does not signify the patient is normal; rather, it simply
means we have not visualized anatomical abnormalities in the structures evaluated on today's ultrasound.
There was significant tenderness elicited on the scan today, indicative of pelvic myofascial pain.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
