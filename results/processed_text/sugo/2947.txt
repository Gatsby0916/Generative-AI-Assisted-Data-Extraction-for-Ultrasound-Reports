The following were identified:
- Polycystic ovarian morphology (right). Clinical correlation is required to decide whether the patient meets
the other Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
Whilst PCOS/PCOM is not a broadly recognized cause of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain, some newer
literature is supportive that anovulatory-induced bleeding may be more painful than ovulatory-induced
bleeding (i.e. periods). Ref: Mann et al. Menstrual Cramps in Anovulatory versus Normally Ovulatory Cycles

and pelvic pain/dysmenorrhea and PCOS/PCOM and endometriosis.
No evidence of deep or ovarian endometriosis or endometriosis-associated adhesions. While we can safely
rule these out based on evidence-based diagnostic test accuracy studies, it is important to note that the
absence of superficial endometriosis does not rule out superficial endometriosis.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with their referring doctor to discuss management strategies going
forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to your
patient's diagnostic journey.
