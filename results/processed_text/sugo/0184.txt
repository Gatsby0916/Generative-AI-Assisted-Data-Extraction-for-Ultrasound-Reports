Congenital anomaly: Nil.
Endometrium: Endometrial thickness measured: 3.5 mm. Endometrial cavity pathology: None.
OVARIES/ADNEXA:
Right Ovary: the right ovary appeared abnormal in appearance and echogenicity, measuring 29 x 15 x
18 mm. Volume 4.3 ml. The following criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology are noted: greater than 20
follicles.
Right Ovary Mobility: Mobile

Bladder: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Ureters: Normal bilaterally with no evidence of hydroureter.
POSTERIOR COMPARTMENT:
Posterior vaginal fornix: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectovaginal septum: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Left uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Right uterosacral ligament: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Torus uterinus: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Bowel: Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross pathology.
Rectouterine pouch (cul de sac): Normal with no evidence of deep endometriosis or other gross
pathology.
Sliding sign: Positive, representing a non-obliterated (i.e. normal) rectouterine pouch.
Superficial endometriosis: Evaluation for superficial endometriosis today was not aided by the
presence of peritoneal fluid. However, we did identify potential superficial endometriosis in the
form of a hyperechoic focus in the rectouterine pouch peritoneum and a collection of hyperechoic
foci in the anterior vesicouterine peritoneum.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal limited abdominal and full pelvic ultrasound today with findings of potential superficial
endometriosis as described as above. Both ovaries have polycystic ovarian morphology. Clinical correlation
is required to decide whether the patient meets the other Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria
for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. There is no deep or ovarian endometriosis nor severe adhesions or
adenomyosis.
During and following the ultrasound performed today, I provided real-time feedback regarding the ultrasound
findings to the patient. I provided some basic information about the findings. I validated the patient's
experiences. I advised them to follow up with you, their referring doctor, to discuss management strategies
going forward. It was a pleasure to be involved in their care. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to
your patient's diagnostic journey.
