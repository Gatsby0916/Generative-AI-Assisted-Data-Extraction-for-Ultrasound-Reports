# Generative AI-Assisted Data Extraction for Ultrasound Reports

This project aims to evaluate the accuracy of generative AI tools in extracting structured data from ultrasound reports. The tool's performance is compared against human extraction and expert review. 

## Objectives:
1. Develop a generative AI tool for data extraction.
2. Evaluate AI-assisted extraction accuracy relative to human and expert review.

## Methods:
- **Human Extraction**: Data is manually extracted by a trained assistant.
- **AI-Assisted Extraction**: Data is extracted using a generative AI tool and exported into Excel for comparison.

## Outcome Measures:
- Accuracy of AI-assisted extraction relative to expert review.
- Accuracy comparison between human and AI extraction.
- Inter-rater agreement using Cohenâ€™s Kappa.

## Data:
The data used in this study comes from a de-identified set of ultrasound reports focused on endometriosis.
